<h1>About me</h1>
<p>Hi there! My name is Julia Terry, I was born and raised in Chicago, IL but currently live in Orlando, FL and work at Walt Disney World. As a true Chicagoan, I love hot dogs, italian beef sandwiches (dipped with hot peppers, obvioulsy), and Fall Out Boy. I have been a Cast Member for a little over seven years now and I absolutely adore my job. </p>
  <h2>Interests & Hobbies</h2>
  <p>In my free time I enjoy:<ul>
  <li>Napping</li>
  <li>Shopping</li>
  <li>Spending time with friends</li>
  <li>Picking up new hobbies to obsess over</li>
</ul></p>
  <h2>Career Goals</h2>
  <p>I adore my current job so I don't see myself going anywhere anytime soon, but my dream would be to work for Google. I haven't narrowed down what my dream position would be but they have so many possibilities that I think the dream would not be too far out of reach if I really set my mind to it. 
  <p>If you would like to reach out, please feel free to <a href="tuliajerry@gmail.com">contact me!</a></p>
